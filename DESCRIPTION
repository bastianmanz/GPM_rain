Description: This package offer users a set of tools to download GPM-IMERG production and NRT data and convert it into a Spacetime-object in R. Furthermore, it offers a set of tools for colocating and evaluating GPM-IMERG pixels against rain gauges. Lastly, a double kriging implementation allows for generating ground-based rainfall fields and an error-weighted merging method allows for combining rain gauges with GPM-IMERG.
